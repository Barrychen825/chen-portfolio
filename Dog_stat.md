The original visualization was published on CNN, and was widely used (https://www.nbc-2.com/story/29376304/dog-lovers-and-dog-eaters-square-off-at-chinas-yulin-festival). As someone who oppose eating dogs, I find this chart not informative enough to communicate with its audeince, which are those who care about people fighting for the ethical treatment of dogs in China. This chart has some pros and cons, so I will identify them, and redeisgn one.
 
Cons:  
The original chart was not informative, and was ugly. It is depicted in a pie chart, but the percentage does not add up to 100% because survey respondents are allowed to make multiple choices. Moreover, there are too many parts clustered inside the pie chart, making it hard to read. The color scheme, although making it easier to identify one group from another, does not mean anything.
  
Pros:  
The icons look nice. You can rarely see "pot" icon in a chart about dogs.  

How I planned to redesign it:
