## About me 
I am Shule (Barry) Chen, a 2nd year MSPPM graduate student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. 
I am an international student from China, and I received a bachelor's degree in Quantitative Economics from University of California, Irvine. 
I use He/Him/His pronounce. 
Plans after graduation includes getting a job, although where and what are still to be decided.
## What I hope to learn
According to my peers, my data presentation was a chore to read through, so I hope to learn how to make my data visually accessible.
