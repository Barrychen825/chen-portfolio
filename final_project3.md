## Data Story  
[Final Project](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/one-mask-to-filter-them-all/index.html)  
  
  The intended audience for the project was, originally, general people who do not wear mask. After the wireframe feedbacks, I narrowed the scope to "general people who do not wear mask in winter". Right after this change, I had an extensive talk with a friend of mine who works at a pharmaceutical lab, and, based on her advice, I narrowed the scope further down to "people over 65-year-old who do not wear mask in winter".  
    
  Since my intended audience are people over 65-year-old, people around me, mostly young people, cannot inform me of what kind of art style and narrative works for older people. Therefore, I turned to my grand parents.  
    
  I showed them some proposed narrative focus, and a few attributes stood out. Those are money, mortality, and epidemics. Therefore, I focused my narrative on those attributes to "hit where it hurts". Moreover, to determine what kind of pictures I should use, I showed them a list of pictures and figured out that they think the pictures of virus are "disgusting". So I decide to use those pictures they find "disgusting" to "persuade" them to use a mask to stay away from those.  
    
  There are 7 data visualizations I did.  
  The first one is a visualization of a direct comparison between hair's diameter and PM2.5 particle diameter, so audience know why they cannot see it with naked eyes. My grandparents live in a town with heavy pollution, so heavy that the town is covered in a grey cloud 24/7. And when they do not see the grey cloud, they think that there is no PM2.5. Trying to use this to remind audience that PM2.5 is always around them.  
  The second one is a PM2.5 concentration map across the world. It informs people where they should avoid to live.  
  The third one is the comparison of annual extra spending on PM2.5 induced diseases between younger people and people older than 65-year-old. This part focuses on money, as elder people tend to avoid getting into hospital and spending money there.  
  The fourth one is the infection and death rate for COVID-19. It shows that older people are easier to be infected, and suffer higher death rate. This will allow my audience focus on prevention of infection instead of recovering from infection.  
  The fifth one is the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside of China to show my audience that the virus is spreading at an increasing speed.  
  The sixth one is the US map for influenza. I put the original data into Plateau, let it play at max speed, recorded it using OBS, and converted it into a gif file.  
  The final one shows that N95 respirator filters out 95% of the particles. I put a "disgusting" virus picture in the "filtered out" part for the final push.
