## Data Story  
  
  The intended audience for the project was, originally, general people who do not wear mask. After the wireframe feedbacks, I narrowed the scope to "general people who do not wear mask in winter". Right after this change, I had an extensive talk with a friend of mine who works at a pharmaceutical lab, and, based on her advice, I narrowed the scope further down to "people over 65-year-old who do not wear mask in winter".  
    
  Since my intended audience are people over 65-year-old, people around me, mostly young people, cannot inform me of what kind of art style and narrative works for older people. Therefore, I turned to my grand parents.  
    
  Firstly, I showed them some proposed narrative focus, and a few attributes stood out. Those are money, mortality, and epidemics.
