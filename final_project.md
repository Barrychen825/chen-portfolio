# Don't run around naked, put a mask on at least (WIP)
  **Part 1: Proposal**   
  **Call to action:**     
  Wear N95 respirator for self-protection (WIP)  
  **Audience:**   
  People living on planet Earth, who care about their own health  
  **Purpose:**   
  Get people to wear procedure N95 respirator for self-protection against epidemic and PM2.5  
  **Summary:**   
  PM2.5 has caused massive additional spending in hospital, and epidemics like influenza and COVID-19 (coronavirus) have caused massive infection and mortality. Therefore, wearing a N95 respirator will not only protect you from spending extra dollar in hospital, but also protect you from risk of dying.
    
    
  **Outline and sketches:**  
  Start with annual extra spending on health due to PM2.5  
  Explain what is PM2.5 and explain PM2.5 effects on body, using pictures.  
  Present PM2.5 concentration across US  
  Use Beeswarm graph to show PM2.5 level in Pittsburgh through 2019. (Data visualization)  
  ![data2](beesworm_sketch.png)  
  Connection sentence: Although PM2.5 will significantly affect your health condition, it is a long term influence with barely identifiable traits at present. There are other "small" things that can destroy your health in a short time.  
  Present COVID-19 story, showing how fast it is spreading across the world  
  Present the spreading of COVID-19 in a GIF, preferably.  
  Connecting sentence: On the other hand, influenza has been spreading through US over the past few months and has caused 13 million illness, and about 6600 influenza related death.  
  Present spreading of influenza through US via GIF  
  Connecting sentence: If people have worn respirator through winter, both diseases would have infected much fewer people.  
  Emphasize that N95 can filter out 95% of particles in the air so it significantly lowers the chance of wearer being infected by any droplet infection disease like COVID-19 and influenza.   
 
  
  **Data:**  
  [PM2.5](https://github.com/Barrychen825/chen-portfolio/blob/master/pit%20pm2.5.csv)  
  The dataset was extracted from United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This PM2.5 dataset contains the daily PM2.5 value of pittsburgh across multiple measuring stations. I would like to create a beesworm graph with this dataset. I tried it, and it showed great result, but some station with insufficient amount of observations may need to be cleared out, so the final result will be both umbiased and look good.  
    
  [Influenza](https://github.com/Barrychen825/chen-portfolio/blob/master/Influenza%20map.csv)  
  This influenza dataset was extracted from Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the website has already used it to produce an US map that change as viewers move the slider. I, however, want to take a step further to make the dataset into a animated graph that automatically change the color of each state, gradually. Therefore, it not only will be easy and beautiful to look at, but also be a work of my own, instead of someone else.

  **Method:**  
  Since shorthand is great for storytelling, I will use shorthand to create a web page that dedicated to advertise the usage of mask for personal protection.  
  For PM2.5 graph, I will use rawgraph for the beesworm.  
  For Influenza graph, as I do not think that we have covered how to make GIF in class, I will try to make it using Photoshop.  
  For color, I will use colorbrewer to make sure that all people can identify all colors in my graphs with ease.
