# Don't run around naked, put a mask on at least (WIP)
  **Part 1: Proposal**   
  **Statement:**     
  Don't run around naked, put a mask on at least (WIP)  
  **Audience:**   
  People living in Pittsburgh, who care about their own health  
  **Purpose:**   
  Get people to wear procedure mask/N95 respirator during winter  
  **Summary:**   
  Pittsburgh's air quality has been one of the worst among cities in the nation. PM2.5 plays an important role in pollution, especially during winter. Influenza, which uses droplet infection to spread, will occure during winter as well. Wearing N95 respirator during winter, therefore, will not only protect people's lung from PM2.5, but also prevent influenza infection.  
    
    
  **Outline and sketches:**  
  Explain what is PM2.5, using picture if possible.  
  Use Beeswarm graph to show PM2.5 level in Pittsburgh through 2019. (Data visualization)  
  ![data2](beesworm_sketch.png)  
  Present N95 respirator, emphasizing its ability to filter out PM2.5 particles.  
  Present influenza graph on a US map, with animation describing how influenza spread in the nation. (Data visualization)  
  ![data3](influenza_sketch.png)    
  Present how droplet infection works, preferably with video.  
  Present procedure mask, emphasizing its ability to prevent germ from drop let infection with price much less than that of N95.  
  Present health care spending related to PM2.5 and influenza for a final push. _**(Still need data)**_  
  
  **Data:**  
  [PM2.5](https://github.com/Barrychen825/chen-portfolio/blob/master/pit%20pm2.5.csv)  
  This PM2.5 dataset contains the daily PM2.5 value of pittsburgh across multiple measuring stations. I would like to create a beesworm graph with this dataset. I tried it, and it showed great result, but some station with insufficient amount of observations may need to be cleared out, so the final result will be both umbiased and look good.  
    
  [Influenza](https://github.com/Barrychen825/chen-portfolio/blob/master/Influenza%20map.csv)  
  This influenza dataset was extracted from Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the website has already used it to produce an US map that change as viewers move the slider. I, however, want to take a step further to make the dataset into a animated graph that automatically change the color of each state, gradually. Therefore, it not only will be easy and beautiful to look at, but also be a work of my own, instead of someone else.
