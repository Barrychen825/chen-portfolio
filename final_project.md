# Don't run around naked, put a mask on at least (WIP)
  **Part 1: Proposal**   
  **Call to action:**     
  Wear N95 respirator for self-protection (WIP)  
  **Audience:**   
  People living on planet Earth, who care about their own health  
  **Purpose:**   
  Get people to wear procedure mask/N95 respirator during winter  
  **Summary:**   
  PM2.5 has caused massive additional spending in hospital, and epidemics like influenza and COVID-19 (coronavirus) have caused massive infection and mortality. Therefore, wearing a N95 respirator will not only protect you from spending extra dollar in hospital, but also protect you from risk of dying.
    
    
  **Outline and sketches:**  
  Start with COVID-19 story, showing how fast it is spreading  
  Present the spreading of COVID-19 in a GIF, preferably.  
  
  Explain what is PM2.5, using picture if possible.  
  Use Beeswarm graph to show PM2.5 level in Pittsburgh through 2019. (Data visualization)  
  ![data2](beesworm_sketch.png)  
  Present N95 respirator, emphasizing its ability to filter out PM2.5 particles.  
  Present influenza graph on a US map, with animation describing how influenza spread in the nation. (Data visualization)  
  ![data3](influenza_sketch.png)    
  Present how droplet infection works, preferably with video.  
  Present procedure mask, emphasizing its ability to prevent germ from drop let infection with price much less than that of N95.  
  Present health care spending related to PM2.5 and influenza for a final push. _**(Still need data)**_  
  
  **Data:**  
  [PM2.5](https://github.com/Barrychen825/chen-portfolio/blob/master/pit%20pm2.5.csv)  
  The dataset was extracted from United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This PM2.5 dataset contains the daily PM2.5 value of pittsburgh across multiple measuring stations. I would like to create a beesworm graph with this dataset. I tried it, and it showed great result, but some station with insufficient amount of observations may need to be cleared out, so the final result will be both umbiased and look good.  
    
  [Influenza](https://github.com/Barrychen825/chen-portfolio/blob/master/Influenza%20map.csv)  
  This influenza dataset was extracted from Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the website has already used it to produce an US map that change as viewers move the slider. I, however, want to take a step further to make the dataset into a animated graph that automatically change the color of each state, gradually. Therefore, it not only will be easy and beautiful to look at, but also be a work of my own, instead of someone else.

  https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm#ILIActivityMap (influenza spreading)  
    
  **Method:**  
  Since shorthand is great for storytelling, I will use shorthand to create a web page that dedicated to advertise the usage of mask for personal protection.  
  For PM2.5 graph, I will use rawgraph for the beesworm.  
  For Influenza graph, as I do not think that we have covered how to make GIF in class, I will try to make it using Photoshop.  
  For color, I will use colorbrewer to make sure that all people can identify all colors in my graphs with ease.
